DESCRIPTION : Redesigning Zepto’s Cart and Card Payment System
Internship Task Presentation

As part of my internship, I redesigned the cart and card payment systems of the Zepto app to address key user pain points. Many users faced difficulty finding groceries quickly and experienced confusion or delays during card payments, leading to frustration and cart abandonment.

Problems Identified
Grocery Selection Issues:

Users struggled to find daily essentials easily.

Confusing category layout and lack of efficient filters.

Too much scrolling and backtracking while adding items.

Card Payment Issues:

Complicated and unclear steps for entering card details.

No visual feedback or confirmation messages.

Users didn’t feel secure during the payment process.

Redesign Goals
Enable quick grocery search and simpler item addition.

Streamline and secure the card payment flow.

Reduce cart abandonment and increase successful checkouts.

Improve user satisfaction through better usability.

Redesign Features
Improved Cart Experience:

Added a search bar inside the cart for faster item lookup.

Introduced clear categories: “Daily Essentials”, “Offers”, and “Frequently Bought”.

Enabled real-time cart updates and easy quantity editing.

Simplified Card Payment Flow:

Smoother, faster, and more reliable shopping experience.

Conclusion
This redesign addresses real user frustrations with clear, practical improvements. By focusing on speed, clarity, and security, the updated cart and payment flow enhances the overall Zepto app experience. This project demonstrates my ability in UI/UX design, user research, and delivering user-centered solutions.
